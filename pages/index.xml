      <description>Once upon a time, back when I taught college math, I made a bunch of videos for my students. I&amp;rsquo;ve collected some of them here, just because.
Matrix Operations    &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   Systems of Linear Equations    &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   Basic Set Theory    &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   Relations and Functions    &amp;nbsp;   &amp;nbsp;   You can find all my videos on my youtube channel.</description>

      <description>Is math a frustrating subject for you? Are you struggling to make sense of it all? I would love to help! My strengths include giving clear explanations, providing a supportive learning environment, and the ability to identify and correct a student&amp;rsquo;s miscomprehensions. I am particularly good at working with students who have had traumatic mathematical experiences in their past. I love working with students who have been convinced that they are “just not smart in math” and helping them achieve their own mathematical victories.</description>
