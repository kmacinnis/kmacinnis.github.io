<h1 id="is-math-a-frustrating-subject-for-you-are-you-struggling-to-make-sense-of-it-all-i-would-love-to-help">Is math a frustrating subject for you? Are you struggling to make sense of it all? I would love to help!</h1>

<p>My strengths include giving clear explanations, providing a supportive learning environment, and the ability to identify and correct a student&rsquo;s miscomprehensions. I am particularly good at working with students who have had traumatic mathematical experiences in their past. I love working with students who have been convinced that they are “just not smart in math” and helping them achieve their own mathematical victories.</p>

<p>I have a Master&rsquo;s Degree in Math, and have also completed extensive postgraduate coursework in education. I taught university-level math for seven years, as well as four years of Developmental Math (catching college students up to where they need to be to take university-level coursework). In the past, I have also developed a tutoring program for a school district to help high-risk high school seniors pass the test that would allow them to graduate in Texas.</p>

<p>I am most likely the best fit for high school or college students, although I have worked with middle school students, and am happy to work with younger students as well. If you&rsquo;d like to see some examples of me explaining things, I have some <a href="https://kmacinnis.github.io/pages/videos/">old videos here</a>.</p>

<p>Individual rate of $60/hour. Discounts are available for paying for multiple sessions in advance, and for group sessions.</p>
